Summary: Whitewood, SK to Lethbridge, AB

### Destinations

#### Jeff: Whitewood, SK to Swift Current, SK

Not much to report here. Jeff had taken the the afternoon off to travel
while the rest of us decided to work today. This was a mistake of mine, I
should have also taken the day off for travel because it turned into a very long
day.

#### Quinn : Regina, SK to Swift Current, SK

I ended up taking off around 5pm. SK time was on par with AB so I wasn't
going to hit any surprises. I also opted to haul the bike with my truck for this
first day. Stupid, right? Going on a motorcycle trip and taking a vehicle for the
first leg of it.

Taking the truck was cumbersome and expensive. I think my fuel bill from Regina
to Lethbridge ended up costing more than the rest of the trip on the bike!

#### J & Q : Swift Current, SK to Medicine Hat, AB

Because I had the truck, I was able to meet up with Jeff in Swift Current.
From here we travelled onwards to Medicine Hat, AB.

Jeff was starting to get tiresome at this point, being on the road for 637km without
a lot of breaks.

I was fine in the luxury of the truck.

#### J & Q : Medicine Hat, AB to Lethbridge, AB

This leg was tiny, only ~160 km. Although I think Jeff and I learned the most
about motorcycle trips in this leg.

I had mentioned before that Jeff was getting pretty tired at Medicine Hat.
Well now he was exhausted.

We stopped halfway and Jeff said he was super tired and cold, it must have been
around 11pm at this time. He stretched his legs and hopped in the truck for some
heat.

After Jeff was all prepped again we headed out for the home stretch.

One of our friends geniously offered up her place for us to stay on the first night.
It was super comfortable after that first ride.

### Summary

## Mileage
- Jeff @ ~800km
    - Iron Butt achieved!
- Quinn @ 625km
    - Lazily in the truck.

I said before that we learned so much in this first day.

- Don't take a vehicle on a motorcycle trip, especially if you're on route
with another biker!
- Plan more stops.
- Take time off for long distances.
- Don't ride too late into the night.
