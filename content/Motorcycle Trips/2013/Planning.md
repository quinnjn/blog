Summary: To Portland!

# Overview

2013 marked the first year for us trying out a motorcycle trip.
Looking back to it now, we should have tried something smaller for our maiden voyage,
but we learned a ton, no one died, and it was a blast.

## Riders

Our team composed of good friends from university that were unfortunately spread
out across Western Canada.

The riders included:

# Planning Phase

## Destination

We wanted to try set our goal for somewhere close enough that we'd all have the
same distance traveled in the end.

The goalpoint we decided on, as you already know: Portland, OR.
